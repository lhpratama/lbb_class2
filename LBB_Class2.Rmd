This dataset can be used to understand and predict student dropouts and academic outcomes. The data includes a variety of demographic, social-economic and academic performance factors related to the students enrolled in higher education institutions. The dataset provides valuable insights into the factors that affect student success and could be used to guide interventions and policies related to student retention.

## 1.2 Objective

Target variable = `Target`

# 2. DATA PREPERATION

The First step is inserting the csv file into R located in data_input and then installing the necessary plugins including `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `caret`, etc.

```{r}
#Read data csv
do <- read.csv("dropouts.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)

library(dplyr)               # Used for data manipulation
library(lubridate)           # Used for date and time manipulation (used by 'glimpse' function)
library(caret)               # Used for data splitting and machine learning (used for 'prop.table' and 'upSample')
library(inspectdf)            # Used for data exploration
library(ggplot2)             # Used for data visualization
library(MASS)                # Used for logistic regression (logistic model fitting)
library(class)               # Used for k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification
library(e1071)               # Used for Naive Bayes
library(partykit)             # Used for Decision Tree
```

Next, we will observe our data set which we exported from the *csv*.

```{r}
head(do)
```

We will also observe the `glimpse()` to check all the columns.

```{r}
glimpse(do)
```

Unique value Description : 1 = Yes 0 = No

```{r}
# Convert selected columns to factors by position
do <- do %>%
  mutate_at(
    vars(c(8:13, 15)),
    as.factor
  )
```

```{r}
# Convert numbers into names
do <- do %>%
  mutate(Marital.status = as.factor(Marital.status)) %>%
  mutate(Marital.status = case_when(
    Marital.status == 1 ~ "Single",
    Marital.status == 2 ~ "Married",
    Marital.status == 3 ~ "Widower",
    Marital.status == 4 ~ "Divorced",
    Marital.status == 5 ~ "Facto union",
    Marital.status == 6 ~ "Legally separated",
    TRUE ~ Marital.status
  ))
```

```{r}
# Convert numbers into names
do <- do %>%
  mutate(Application.mode = as.factor(Application.mode)) %>%
  mutate(Application.mode = case_when(
    Application.mode == "1" ~ "1st phase—general contingent",
    Application.mode == "2" ~ "Ordinance No. 612/93",
    Application.mode == "3" ~ "1st phase—special contingent (Azores Island)",
    Application.mode == "4" ~ "Holders of other higher courses",
    Application.mode == "5" ~ "Ordinance No. 854-B/99",
    Application.mode == "6" ~ "International student (bachelor)",
    Application.mode == "7" ~ "1st phase—special contingent (Madeira Island)",
    Application.mode == "8" ~ "2nd phase—general contingent",
    Application.mode == "9" ~ "3rd phase—general contingent",
    Application.mode == "10" ~ "Ordinance No. 533-A/99, item b2) (Different Plan)",
    Application.mode == "11" ~ "Ordinance No. 533-A/99, item b3 (Other Institution)",
    Application.mode == "12" ~ "Over 23 years old",
    Application.mode == "13" ~ "Transfer",
    Application.mode == "14" ~ "Change in course",
    Application.mode == "15" ~ "Technological specialization diploma holders",
    Application.mode == "16" ~ "Change in institution/course",
    Application.mode == "17" ~ "Short cycle diploma holders",
    Application.mode == "18" ~ "Change in institution/course (International)",
    TRUE ~ Application.mode
  ))

```

```{r}
# Convert numbers into names
do <- do %>%
  rename(Nationality = Nacionality) %>%
  mutate(Nationality = as.factor(Nationality)) %>%
  mutate(
    Nationality = case_when(
      Nationality == 1 ~ "Portuguese",
      Nationality == 2 ~ "German",
      Nationality == 3 ~ "Spanish",
      Nationality == 4 ~ "Italian",
      Nationality == 5 ~ "Dutch",
      Nationality == 6 ~ "English",
      Nationality == 7 ~ "Lithuanian",
      Nationality == 8 ~ "Angolan",
      Nationality == 9 ~ "Cape Verdean",
      Nationality == 10 ~ "Guinean",
      Nationality == 11 ~ "Mozambican",
      Nationality == 12 ~ "Santomean",
      Nationality == 13 ~ "Turkish",
      Nationality == 14 ~ "Brazilian",
      Nationality == 15 ~ "Romanian",
      Nationality == 16 ~ "Moldova (Republic of)",
      Nationality == 17 ~ "Mexican",
      Nationality == 18 ~ "Ukrainian",
      Nationality == 19 ~ "Russian",
      Nationality == 20 ~ "Cuban",
      Nationality == 21 ~ "Colombian",
      TRUE ~ Nationality
    )
  )
```

By following the categorical description, we will change uniques from Gender

```{r}
# Changing uniques from Gender
do <- do %>%
  mutate(
    Gender = case_when(
      Gender == 1 ~ "Male",
      Gender == 0 ~ "Female",
      TRUE ~ Gender
    )
  )
```

```{r}
# Mutating char column into factor
do <- do %>%
  mutate_at(vars("Marital.status", "Application.mode", "Gender" , "Nationality"), as.factor)
```


❓ Variabel target: `Target`

Afterward, we will need to check if there are any rows with missing value or NA data

```{r}
# Checking NA Data
length(complete.cases(do))
```

```{r}
# Filtering out Enrolled value since we only needed Graduatees and Dropouts
do <- do %>%
  filter(Target != "Enrolled")
```

```{r}
# Checking the balanced of target
prop.table(table(do$Target))
```

# 3. DATA EXPLORATION

```{r}
head(do)
```

Unique value Description : 1 = Yes 0 = No

```{r}
summary(do)
```

```{r}
ggplot(do, aes(x=Course)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "grey", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Number of Courses Taken ", subtitle= "distribution", x = "Number of Courses", y = "Frequency") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

# 4. PREDICTION

Prediction will be made three times with three different models, **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**. This three-fold prediction strategy enables a comprehensive evaluation of the dataset, taking into account various modeling techniques and their respective strengths. This approach ultimately contributes to a well-rounded understanding of the data and its predictive potential.

First step is by splitting the data set into two: **training** and **test**

```{r}
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
set.seed(501)

# sampling
split_sample <- sample(x = nrow(do), size = nrow(do)*0.75) 

# splitting
do_train <- do[split_sample,] 
do_test <- do[-split_sample,] 
```

```{r}
do_test_wt <- do_test[,c(-16)]
head(do_test_wt)
```

## 4.1 Naive Bayes

```{r}
#Creating Model Naive Bayes
model_nb<- naiveBayes(Target ~ ., data = do_test)  
```

```{r}
#Creating Predict Naive Bayes
pred_nb <- predict(model_nb, newdata = do_test_wt) 
```

```{r}
#Generate Confusion Matrix
confusionMatrix(table(pred_nb, do_test$Target)) 
```

## 4.2 Decision Tree

```{r}
#Creating model
model_dt <- ctree(Target ~ ., do_train,
                               control = ctree_control(mincriterion = 0.1, 
                                                       minsplit = 0.1,
                                                       minbucket = 120))
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width= 20}
#Generate plot
plot(model_dt, type = "simple")
```

```{r}
#Predicting in Train

# prediksi kelas di data test
model_dt_train <- predict(model_dt, do_train)


# confusion matrix data test
confusionMatrix(data = model_dt_train, 
                reference = do_train$Target, 
                positive = "Graduate")
```

```{r}
#Predicting in Test

# prediksi kelas di data train
#model_dt_test <- predict(model_dt, do_train)

# confusion matrix data train
#confusionMatrix(data = model_dt_test,
               # reference = do_test$Target,
              #  positive = "Graduate")
```
## ERROR me-launch Predicting in Test ^^ kenapa ya?


## 4.3 Random Forest

```{r}
#???
```
